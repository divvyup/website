        <p>You don't eat the same things as your roommates. 
        Trying to figure out who owes what from the grocery 
        store is a pain, and making an extra trip just for 
        yourself is even more inconvenient.
        <br><i><b>That's where we come in.</b></i><br>
        Sign up, make a group, then buy some food. Give us the receipt
        or eReceipt, all you'll have to do is tap on the things you eat. 
        We'll automatically split the cost between you and your roommates 
        and we'll even remember what you eat for next time.</p>
