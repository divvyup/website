      pay for yours... That's where we come in. <br>Sign up,
      make a group, buy some food and give us the receipt
      or eReceipt. We'll parse everything out, all you have to
      do is tap on the things you eat. We'll automatically 
      split the cost between you and your roommates and we'll
      even remember what you eat for next time.</p>
