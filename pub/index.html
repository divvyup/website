      <p>You don't eat the same things as your roommates. 
      Trying to figure out who owes what on a reciept is a
      pain, and making an extra trip to the store just for 
      yourself is even more inconvenient.
      <br><i>That's where we come in.</i><br>
      Sign up, make a group, then buy some food and give us the receipt
      or eReceipt. We'll parse everything out, all you have to
      do is tap on the things you eat. We'll automatically 
      split the cost between you and your roommates and we'll
      even remember what you eat for next time.</p>
